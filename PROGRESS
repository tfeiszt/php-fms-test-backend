This is my first Phalcon projects, so I played a bit with that before I fork this repo.
For first sight: It's pretty usable, seems fine. I like the structure of the codebase. Only problem is: it was a headache to build a correct source on my local MAMP.

The task: I should create a "File manager system". Task description doesn't mention any exact expectations how should it work, but mention I can use db if I want.
I checked the attached interfaces and those implies it should be handle actually files too.
So my goal is: I trying to make a web application which is like an old "Norton Commander". It has two file list panel and an action bar. User can do the basic file actions such as:
- creating a txt file
- creating a folder
- copy a file
- move a file (using the move to rename as well)
- delete a file

All this actions will be logged into a mysql table.

For this I will use the following technologies:
- PHP 5.5.10
- Mysql 5.5
- Phalcon 2.x
- jQuery
- Bootstrap 3
- less
- npm
- grunt
